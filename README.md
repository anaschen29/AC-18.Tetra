# AC-18.Tetra
Python files for the TETRA project. 

This code was developped throughout the 18.Tetra project, an undergraduate research project regarding tetrahedra led by Prof. Poonen at MIT. 

The code is split into a few files. 

- tetra.py: various computations for tetrahedra, converting between edge lengths and dihedral angles, etc... 

- symbolic tetra.py: similar to tetra.py, but with symbolic computations for exact values (primarily using sympy)

- dimension.sage: computing the dimension of a tetrahedron (defined as the $\mathbb{Q}$-span of the dihedral angles in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}\pi$).
