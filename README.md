Setup is pretty straight forward. The base directory is assumed to be the place where the repository is saved in your computer.
1. Have python3 and virtualenv installed
2. `source tetra-env/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 -i tetra.py` or `python3 -i 'Symbolic Tetra.py'` depending on which modules you want to use.
